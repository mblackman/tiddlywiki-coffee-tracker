!! Coffee Freshness Indicators

Configure when coffee is considered at peak freshness:

|!Setting |!Days After Roast |
|Peak Freshness Starts |<$edit-text tiddler="$:/plugins/mblackman/coffee-tracker/config/freshness/peak-start" tag="input" default="7"/> days |
|Peak Freshness Ends |<$edit-text tiddler="$:/plugins/mblackman/coffee-tracker/config/freshness/peak-end" tag="input" default="21"/> days |
|Still Good Until |<$edit-text tiddler="$:/plugins/mblackman/coffee-tracker/config/freshness/optimal-end" tag="input" default="60"/> days |

''Guidelines:''
* ''Very Fresh'' (< {{$:/plugins/mblackman/coffee-tracker/config/freshness/peak-start}} days): Coffee is still degassing
* ''Peak'' ({{$:/plugins/mblackman/coffee-tracker/config/freshness/peak-start}}-{{$:/plugins/mblackman/coffee-tracker/config/freshness/peak-end}} days): Optimal flavor development
* ''Good'' ({{$:/plugins/mblackman/coffee-tracker/config/freshness/peak-end}}-{{$:/plugins/mblackman/coffee-tracker/config/freshness/optimal-end}} days): Still enjoyable
* ''Aging'' (> {{$:/plugins/mblackman/coffee-tracker/config/freshness/optimal-end}} days): Flavor declining
