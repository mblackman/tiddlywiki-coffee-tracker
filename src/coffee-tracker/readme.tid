!! Quick Start Guide

!!! Getting Started

# Click the ''☕ Coffee'' tab in the sidebar to open the dashboard
# Add your first roaster using ''+ New Roaster''
# Create a coffee type using ''+ New Coffee Type''
# Track a bag purchase with ''+ Purchase Bag''
# Log your first brew with ''+ Log Brew''

!!! Understanding the Data Types

The plugin uses five main data types organized in a hierarchy:

```
Roaster
  └─ Coffee Type (the coffee product/blend)
      └─ Coffee Bag Instance (specific bag you purchased)
          └─ Brew Log (individual brewing sessions)

Equipment (used in Brew Logs)
```

''Roaster'' → Companies or roasters that produce coffee (e.g., "Counter Culture Coffee")

''Coffee Type'' (tagged as `CoffeeBag`) → The specific coffee product including origin, processing, roast level (e.g., "Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Natural")

''Coffee Bag Instance'' (tagged as `CoffeeBagInstance`) → Individual purchases of coffee types with specific roast and purchase dates (e.g., "Ethiopia Yirgacheffe - Jan 2026")

''Equipment'' → Your brewing tools categorized by type: Brewer, Grinder, Scale, Kettle

''Brew Log'' → Individual brewing sessions with complete parameters and ratings

!! Tips for Best Results

!!! Data Entry Best Practices

# ''Add roasters first'' before creating coffee types - they'll appear in the dropdown
# ''Use accurate roast dates'' for meaningful freshness tracking
# ''Record complete brew parameters'' to identify patterns and improve your technique
# ''Be consistent with ratings'' - use the same scale (recommend 1-10) for useful averages
# ''Add detailed notes'' to capture what worked or what you'd change next time
# ''Mark bags as finished'' when empty to keep your active bags list clean

!!! Freshness Tracking Tips

The plugin automatically calculates freshness based on the `bag-roast-date`:

* ''Peak'': 7-21 days after roast - flavors are developed and vibrant
* ''Optimal'': 21-60 days after roast - well-integrated flavors, still excellent
* ''Aging'': 60+ days after roast - past prime but still usable

Different coffees peak at different times:

* Light roasts often need more rest (10-21 days)
* Dark roasts peak earlier (7-14 days)
* Natural/anaerobic processed coffees may age differently

!!! Brewing Parameter Guidelines

Track these key parameters for repeatability:

* ''Dose'': Amount of coffee used (grams)
* ''Yield'': Amount of brewed coffee (grams or ml)
* ''Ratio'': Calculated from dose/yield (e.g., 1:15 = 20g dose, 300g yield)
* ''Water Temperature'': Usually 88-96°C depending on roast level
* ''Grind Setting'': Note your grinder's setting for consistency
* ''Brew Time'': Total contact time (varies by method)

!!! Rating System Suggestions

Use a consistent 1-10 scale:

* ''9-10'': Exceptional, memorable cup
* ''7-8'': Great daily drinker, very enjoyable
* ''5-6'': Decent, drinkable but room for improvement
* ''3-4'': Underwhelming, needs adjustment
* ''1-2'': Poor extraction or off flavors
